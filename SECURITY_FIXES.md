## Fixed Vulnerabilities

### 1. Hardcoded Password in Test Files (CWE-798)

**File**: `test/api/loginApiSpec.ts` line 142  
**Issue**: Hardcoded Base64-encoded password in source code  
**Severity**: HIGH  
**CVE Pattern**: Similar to CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials)

#### Original Code:
```typescript
password: 'bW9jLmxpYW1nQGhjaW5pbW1pay5ucmVvamI='
```

#### Fixed Code:
```typescript
const testPassword = process.env.BJOERN_TEST_PASSWORD || 'defaultTestPassword123!'
password: testPassword
```

#### Remediation:
- Removed hardcoded Base64-encoded password
- Implemented environment variable-based configuration
- Added fallback default password for development
- Prevents credential exposure in source code

#### Security Benefits:
- ✅ Credentials no longer exposed in version control
- ✅ Different passwords can be used per environment
- ✅ Reduces risk of credential theft from code repositories
- ✅ Follows secure coding best practices

#### Environment Setup:
To use this fix, set the environment variable:
```bash
export BJOERN_TEST_PASSWORD="your_secure_password_here"
```
